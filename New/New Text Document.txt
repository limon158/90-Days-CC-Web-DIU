on-periodic function can be represented as an integral over a continuous range of frequencies. The concept of Laplace Transformation and Fourier Transformation play a vital role in diverse areas of science and technology  such  as  electric  analysis,  communication  engineering,  control  engineering,  linear  system,  analysis, statistics, optics, quantum physics, solution of partial differential operation, etc. In solving problems relating to these fields, one usually encounters problems on time invariants, differential equations, time and frequency domains for non â€“ periodic wave forms. This paper provides the reader with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of Laplace transform and Fourier transform; and gain an understanding of some of the very important and basic applications of these fundamentals to electric circuits and signal design and solution to related pro
